## Description

If you are using more than 1 device, then this app is for you!

Do you find jotting down your sudden thoughts frustrating because there isn't any perfect place to write it down? Do you find copying text from one device to another frustrating? This app solves them all!

Sometimes we like to send things to ourself using chat apps because it helps us transfer text or media to another device of ours. However, major chat apps in the current market are so full-fledged that they take time to load up. Even worse, we always need to take extra care not to send things to the wrong people.

Ideas Cloud is a chat app that your only contact is YOURSELF!

Quickly note down your thoughts in a chat-like manner without ever splitting your thoughts to think about how to organize ever growing notes. All notes will be automatically transferred (synced) across all your devices, let it be Android, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Windows, Web or Linux! Need to send things to your other devices? Just send it in Ideas Cloud. Never need to load up large chat app or find a right folder inside your note app anymore!
