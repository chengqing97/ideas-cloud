# Paperbox

Send things to yourself.

## Description

If you are using more than 1 device, then this app is for you!

Do you find sending files or copying text from one device to another frustrating? This app solves them all!

Sometimes we like to send things to ourself using chat apps because it helps us transfer text or media to another device of ours. However, major chat apps in the current market are so full-fledged that they take time to load up. Even worse, we always need to take extra care not to send things to the wrong people.

Paperbox let you send things to YOURSELF!
